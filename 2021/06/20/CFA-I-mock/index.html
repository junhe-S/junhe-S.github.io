<p><p><span>Tamlorn Mager, CFA, is an analyst at Pyallup Portfolio Management. CFA Institute recently notified Mager that his CFA Institute membership was suspended for a year because he violated the CFA Institute Code of Ethics. A hearing panel also came to the same conclusion. Mager subsequently notified CFA Institute that he does not accept the sanction or the hearing panel's conclusion. Which of the following actions by Mager would be most consistent with the CFA Institute Professional Conduct Program?</span></p></p>
<p><ul>

<details>
  <summary>Answer Explanation</summary>
  <p>The Designated Officer may impose a summary suspension on a member or candidate that may be rejected or accepted by the member or candidate. If the member or candidate does not accept the proposed sanction, the matter is referred to a hearing panel composed of Disciplinary Review Committee (DRC) members and CFA Institute member volunteers affiliated with the DRC. In this case, the hearing panel also affirmed the suspension decision by the Designated Officer, and therefore, the member loses the right to use his designation for a one-year period. Upon expiration of the suspension period, the analyst would be able to use his CFA designation.</p>

A micro finance loan company lent hermoney to pay off the tuition loan in full, including penalties and interest.The micro finance loan company even extended further credit to pay for herparents' outstanding medical bills. Unfortunately, her parents' health problemsescalated to the point that Ng had to take extensive time away from work todeal with the issues.

  </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Correct Answer: A</span></p><p><span>Although Ng's first loan default, whichplayed a part in the subsequent bankruptcy, is a result of poor financialchoices (i.e., paying for higher wedding costs rather than her tuition loan),neither of the loan defaults or the bankruptcy involves fraudulent or deceitfulbusiness conduct but rather unfortunate personal circumstances.

  <summary>Answer Explanation</summary>
  </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Correct Answer: C</span></p><p><span>There is no indication the analyst had accessto material nonpublic information and was in violation of Standard II(A):Material Nonpublic Information. Specifically, Tucker did not have informationconcerning any decision by Bowron to acquire Hanchin stock because she is not apart of Bowron's decision-making team that determines the companies it plans totake over. The analyst had indicated numerous companies were viable options fortake over, and she did not single out any one company in particular. However,trading the stock of a company the analyst recommended as an acquisitioncandidate does violate Standard IV(A): Loyalty because she did not give heremployer the opportunity to take advantage of her skill/recommendation prior tobuying the shares for her own portfolio. In addition, the analyst violatedStandard VI(B): Priority of Transactions, which requires that investmenttransactions for clients and employers must have priority over investmenttransactions in which a member or candidate is the beneficial owner despite thefact that there are no stock pre-clearance procedures at Bowron.</span></p><p><span>

</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>When Abdullah Younis, CFA, was hired as aportfolio manager at an asset management firm two years ago, he was told hecould allocate his work hours as he saw fit. At that time, Younis served on theboard of three non-public golf equipment companies and managed a pooledinvestment fund for several members of his immediate family. Younis was notcompensated for his board service or for managing the pooled fund. Younis'sinvestment returns attract interest from friends and co-workers who persuadehim to include their assets in his investment pool. Younis recently retiredfrom all board responsibilities and now spends more than 80% of his timemanaging the investment pool for which he charges non-family members amanagement fee. Younis has never told his employer about any of theseactivities. To comply with the CFA Institute Standards of Professional Conductwith regard to his business activities over the past two years, Younis wouldleast likely be required to disclose which of the following to his employer?</span></p><p><span>
<ul>
  <li><p> Familyinvestment pool management</span><span></p></li>
  <li><p> Board activities</span><span></p></li>
  <li><p> Non-family member management fees</span><span></p></li></ul>
<details>
  <summary>Answer Explanation</summary>
  </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Correct Answer: B</span></p><p><span>Golf equipment is a business independent ofthe financial services industry such that any board obligations would notlikely be considered a conflict of interest requiring disclosure according toStandard IV(B): Additional Compensation Arrangements. Standard IV(B) requiresmembers and candidates to obtain permission from their employer beforeaccepting compensation or other benefits from third parties for the servicesthat might create a conflict with their employer’s interests. Managinginvestments for family and non-family members could likely create a conflict ofinterest for Younis's employer and should be disclosed to his employer.</span></p><p><span>

Hajak recentlystarted her own investment research firm, Hajak Investment Advisory. One of herformer clients at Cornerstone asks Hajak to update a research report she wroteon a real estate company when she was at Cornerstone. Hajak updates the report,which she had copied to her personal computer without the bank's knowledge, andreplaces references to the bank with her new firm, Hajak Investment Advisory.Hajak also incorporates the conclusions of a real estate study conducted by theRealtors Association that appeared in the Wall Street Journal. She cites theWall Street Journal as her source in her report. She provides the revisedreport free of charge along with a cover letter for the bank's client to becomea client of her firm. Concerning the reissued research report, Hajak leastlikely violated the CFA Institute Standards of Professional Conduct becauseshe:</span></p><p><span>

  <li><p> solicited the bank's client.</span><span></p></li>

<details>
  <summary>Answer Explanation</summary>
  </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Correct Answer: B</span></p><p><span>Soliciting the bank's client did not violateStandard IV(A): Loyalty because the manager is no longer an employee of thebank and there is no indication she obtained the client information from banksources. But Hajak has violated Standard V(C): Record Retention because whenshe left the bank, she took the property of the bank without express permissionto do so. In addition, she violated Standard I(C): Misrepresentation bycreating research materials without attribution, which is demonstrated when sheadds to the new report a real estate study she saw in the Wall Street Journaland only references the Journal. In all instances, a member or candidate mustcite the actual source of the information. If she does not obtain the reportand review the information, the manager runs the risk of relying on secondhandinformation that may misstate facts. Best practice would be either to obtainthe complete study from its original author and cite only that author or to usethe information provided by the intermediary and cite both sources.</span></p><p><span>

  <summary>Answer Explanation</summary>
  <p><span>Solution: B . </span></p>
<p><span>The IS curve represents combinations of income and the real interest rate at which planned expenditure equals income. Equivalently, it represents combinations such that</span></p>
<p><span>S(Y) = I( r) + (G</span><math style="background-color:#" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <semantics> <mo>–</mo>  </semantics> </math><span> T) + (X </span><math style="background-color:#" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <semantics> <mo>–</mo>  </semantics> </math><span>&nbsp;M)</span></p>
<p><span>where S( Y) indicates that planned saving is a (increasing) function of income and l(r) indicates that planned investment is a (decreasing) function of the real interest rate. To maintain this relationship, an increase in government spending (G) requires an increase in saving at any given level of the interest rate (r). This implies an increase in income ( Y) at each interest rate level</span><math style="background-color:#" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <semantics> <mo>—</mo>  </semantics> </math><span>a rightward shift of the IS curve. </span></p>
<p><span>Unless the LM curve is vertical, the IS and LM curves will intersect at a higher level of aggregate expenditure/income. Since the LM curve embodies a constant price level, this implies an increase in aggregate expenditure at each price level</span><math style="background-color:#" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <semantics> <mo>—</mo>  </semantics> </math><span>a rightward shift of the Aggregate Demand curve.</span></p>

<details>
  <summary>Answer Explanation</summary>
  <p><span>Solution: C.</span></p>
<p><span>The increase in the average tax rate in 2005, as indicated by the decrease in the value of the tax burden (the tax burden equals one minus the average tax rate), offset the improvement in efficiency indicated by higher asset turnover); as a result, ROE remained unchanged at 18.90 percent. Statement A is not correct because the EBIT margin, measuring profitability, was unchanged in 2005; furthermore, no information is given on liquidity.

  <summary>Answer Explanation</summary>
  </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Solution: C </span></p><p><span>When the holder of a bond experiences aone-time parallel shift in the yield curve, the Macaulay duration statisticidentifies the number of years necessary to hold the bond so that the losses(or gains) from coupon reinvestment offset the gains (or losses) from marketprice changes. The duration gap is the difference between the Macaulay durationand the investment horizon. Modified duration approximates the percentage pricechange of a bond given a change in its yield-to-maturity.</span></p><p><span>

  <p><span>Solution: C</span></p>
<p><span>The co-movement measures between the assets increases (i.e., covariance and correlation) as the number of assets in the equally weighted portfolio increases. The contribution of each individual asset’s variance (or standard deviation) to the portfolio’s volatility decreases as the number of assets in the equally weighted portfolio increases.
